# SicK girL Dump
This is a dump of the contents of the [SicK girL](https://sickgirl.neocities.org/) website from 2020-05-27, just minutes before the website was deleted by the site owner.

**sicK girL** is the name of a now-deleted website that was hosted on Neocitites from 2020-05-10 to 2020-50-27. The site was probably written by a 14-to-15-year-old girl, who much like [Sol Pais](https://wiki.neozones.club/index.php?title=Dissolvedgirl), was seemly interested in the Columbine high school massacre, where two teenagers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, murdered 12 students and a teacher on 1999-04-20.
